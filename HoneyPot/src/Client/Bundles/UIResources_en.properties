block = How to block an IP address:
step1 = 1.  Open your web browser. Type in 192.168.0.1 to access your router's administrative page. If that IP address does not work, type in 192.168.0.0, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.178.1 or 192.168.1.2. 
step12 = If none of these work, the next instructions will help you finding the router's administrative page depending on your computer's operating system.
step13 = Windows: press the Windows key + the "R" key at the same time. This will prompt the run window. In the box type "cmd" and click OK. The commandline should now be open. Type "ipconfig" and press enter. Find the Default Gateway and type this address in to your browser. The next image shows an example of where to find the Default Gateway.
step2 = 2.  Enter your admin user name and password when prompted.
